            <p>Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency, in many ways similiar to Bitcoin.
          However, the main difference to Bitcoin is that{" "}<em>every transaction in Monero is private</em>.</p>

            <Divider />

            <p>This means that the sender, reciever and the amount of ever
            transaction are hidden with cryptographic techniques. While it is
            fascinating to some to learn about how Monero works, it is not
            required to be able to use it. Just like most drivers don't understand
            the internals of the combustion engine.</p>
